  <h1>LG Introduces $12 Monthly Subscription to Enable Color on New Smart TVs</h1>
  <p class="date">By Tech Correspondent | June 8, 2025</p>
</header>

<p><strong>SEOUL, South Korea</strong> — LG Electronics has unveiled a new subscription-based feature for its latest line of Smart TVs that has already generated significant consumer backlash: a $12 per month fee to enable full-color picture display.</p>

<p>Under the new model, LG’s 2025 OLED and QNED Smart TVs will ship with displays locked in grayscale mode. To access the TVs’ full-color capabilities, customers are prompted during setup to enroll in LG’s new “Color+” subscription service.</p>

<blockquote>
  “Color+ unlocks the next generation of visual immersion,” said Ji-Hoon Park, Senior VP of LG’s Home Entertainment division. “We believe customers will embrace the opportunity to experience color as a premium, software-enhanced experience.”
</blockquote>

<h2>🎨 Consumer Response and Industry Reaction</h2>
<p>The reaction from consumers and industry analysts has been swift and largely negative. Forums such as Reddit and AVSForum have seen a surge in threads criticizing LG's new model. The hashtag <strong>#ColorGate</strong> trended globally on X (formerly Twitter) within hours of the announcement.</p>

<blockquote>
  “This is the kind of dystopian monetization we feared,” said tech analyst Marcus Yi of ScreenThink. “Charging customers extra to see the world in color — something that has been standard for decades — risks setting a troubling precedent for the entire consumer electronics industry.”
</blockquote>

<h2>📷 Graphic 2: Customer Setup Screen</h2>

<h2>📉 Public Sentiment and Market Concerns</h2>
<p>Early buyers of LG’s C5 and G5 OLED models have taken to social media to voice concerns, with some returning their TVs in protest.</p>

<blockquote>
  “I paid nearly $2,000 for this TV and I’m watching <em>Avatar</em> like it’s a 1940s newsreel,” said Angela McCarthy, a Seattle-based customer. “This can’t be the future of home entertainment.”
</blockquote>

<p>Legal experts are also examining the move for potential violations of consumer protection laws, especially where advertising color capabilities without subscription disclaimers could be misleading.</p>

<h2>🔮 What’s Next for the TV Industry?</h2>
<p>Other manufacturers have so far remained silent on the development. However, analysts speculate that if LG’s Color+ model generates sufficient recurring revenue, competitors may follow suit with similar subscription-locked features, potentially affecting resolution, refresh rates, or even HDMI port access.</p>

<h2>📎 LG's Official Statement</h2>
<blockquote>
  “The Color+ service is entirely optional and designed for those who wish to enhance their viewing experience with the latest in adaptive visual technology. All core TV features remain accessible without a subscription.”
</blockquote>

<p>Still, critics argue that basic color display should not be positioned as a premium feature in 2025.</p>
